# Yusuf Saquib Website

This is version 3 of my website. The motivation behind this project was to learn React and create a website that I can modify without having to edit the source files. 

This website will accomplish this goal by being linked to a database as well as having a way to login as the owner of the website and modify content through an admin dashboard.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide a template for others to use, rather as a way to demonstrate the progress of my learning and to diversify my portfolio.

However, if there is any demand, I can modify the repo to act more as a template for people to use or learn from.
