# Yusuf Saquib's Website

ysaquib-website-v3 is the third version of my [personal professional portfolio website](https://www.yusufsaquib.com). The motivation behind a third version was the fact that the previous version did not allow for easy website modification. Specifically, in order to change any of the data on the website, I had to change the source files, rebuild the project, and redeploy to the hosting server. Thus began my journey into creating a website that could interact with a database and involve a form of authentication using React, Redux, and Firebase.

After learning and understanding the basics, I had some fun with adding features such as a blog page to post blogs (of course) and an admin dashboard where I can control some website data directly from the website itself. Furthermore, I ensured that the source code was documented and modular so that I can continue to add features in the future with minimal effort. 

I do plan to add more pages soon, specifically a page that acts as a Quick CV displaying everything else that did not make it onto my Resume in a very elegant manner (at least that's the goal).

As a result, this project is non-collaborative. However if you notice any vulnerabilities, please let me know :)
